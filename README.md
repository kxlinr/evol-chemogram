# Chemogram

This is the public repository to recreate the analysis and figures from "Personalizing chemotherapy drug selection using a novel transcriptomic chemogram".

The predictive signatures can be extracted using the code found [here](https://github.com/jessicascarborough/cissig). 

The code should be run in the following order:
1. `setup.Rmd`
2. `chemogram_pipeline.Rmd`
3. `null_bootstrap.R`
